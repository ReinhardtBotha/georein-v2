summary: A quick demonstration of a workflow for contour generation using point cloud data in Global Mapper

# Introduction

Here is a quick video demonstration of my workflow for contour generation using point cloud (lidar in this case) data in Global Mapper.
The data that I used was the lidar point clouds for City of Cape Town (South Africa), but the same workflow can be used for any point cloud data format. Global Mapper 18.0 was used in the recording of this tutorial.

# Steps taken in the workflow

1. Load the point cloud data into Global Mapper.
2. Create an elevation grid from the point cloud data.
3. Generate Contours from the elevation grid created in step 2.
