# Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Reinhardt

I am a GIS Specialist and Full-Stack Developer with over 9 years' experience in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. My experience has been gained in various Water, Treatment, Urban Infrastructure, Electrical, Environmental, Transport, Stormwater, Digital, Project Management, and Multidisciplinary engineering projects.
