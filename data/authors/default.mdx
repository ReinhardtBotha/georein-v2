# Hi 👋 I'm Reinhardt

I am a GIS Specialist and Full-Stack Developer with over 9 years' experience in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. My experience has been gained in various Water, Treatment, Urban Infrastructure, Electrical, Environmental, Transport, Stormwater, Digital, Project Management, and Multidisciplinary engineering projects. During this time, I have been responsible for managing, maintaining, and creating various digital products. These include high-quality map production, mobile GIS data collection solutions, and web map applications amongst others. I have also played a key role in the Digital Transformation of the organization and serve on the company’s BIM Committee, where I am responsible for integrating GIS and BIM. I have been involved with projects for private clients, government departments and municipalities.
