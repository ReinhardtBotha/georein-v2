## Problem

Neck pain is a prevalent health issue caused by the excessive use of electronic devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets. This prolonged usage often leads to poor neck posture, resulting in discomfort, pain, and long-term musculoskeletal problems, commonly referred to as "text neck".

## Solution

WeaUp is a mobile app that helps users recognize poor neck posture and its impact on discomfort. By monitoring neck posture throughout the day using motion sensors in mobile devices and connected earbuds, WeaUp provides real-time feedback and reminders. Users can track their progress with detailed analytics to make effective improvements.

With gamification features like our mascot, goals, and daily streaks, WeaUp transforms posture correction into an enjoyable journey towards healthier habits.
